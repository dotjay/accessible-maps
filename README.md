# Accessible Maps

A [Scripting Enabled](http://scriptingenabled.org/) project to build a more accessible map interface that may be used by people regardless of age or ability.

The project currently provides an alternative way of using [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) using the Google Maps API.

Some of the ideas are respectfully based on the work done on the [Easy YouTube Player](http://icant.co.uk/easy-youtube/).
