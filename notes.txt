NB: When working with the Google Maps API locally, work under http://localhost/ and you won't need an API key.

NOTES:
			- More ideas for names:
				- My Map / My YouTube
					- "My Maps" is too close to what Google call their custom maps feature :(
				- My Map, My Way
					- Is it too close to the BBC's "My Web, My Way"?
				- Easy Map
					- We don't particularly like the word 'easy'.
				- Accessimap
					- It's not real word(s) - does that make it less accessible?
			- Get local information:
				- Multimap has an open API:
					http://www.multimap.com/openapi/
					http://blog.multimap.com/category/multimap-open-api/
				- pushpin API:
					http://www.pushpin.com/api/docs/rest/
					http://www.programmableweb.com/api/pushpin-location-data
			- The guy from the hack day who had oodles of locality data; was he something to do with the uni?
			- Is zoomed out more a better place to start the map, e.g. so that users can identify a landmark? Nearest town, major road...


ACTIONS:
			GENERAL:
			[*] move code from dotjay.co.uk/scriptingenabled
			[*] move code into a Google hosted project

			INTERFACE:
			[ ] change marker image.
			[ ] cross on toggle.
			[ ] change the URL.
			[ ] change the word 'reset' to something else.
			[ ] change the name?
			[ ] different control interfaces
				- linear left
				- gamepad
				- grouped direction controls, up down vert, left right horiz
				- surrounded controls
			[ ] indicate how zoomed in am I?
			[ ] disable the zoom in/out buttons if at the zoom limits.

			STYLES:
			[ ] make map controls buttons with background images for the icons.
				- text can resize.
				- is accessible to partially sighted users.

			FUNCTIONALITY:
			[ ] tidy the associative arrays - use objects in JS, dumb ass
			[ ] add directions lookup.
				- function is in js/directions.js
				- use ?output=html on the end of the URL in Google Maps
				- e.g. http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&source=s_d&abauth=6cea6a25%3A4DqAoMoOTDjvxNagB5usLbnbuIw&output=html&hl=en&saddr=WC1H9NE&daddr=e2+8AA&btnG=Get+Directions
			[ ] reload the tiles on resize.
			[ ] disable the zoom in/out buttons if at the zoom limits.
			[ ] dynamically generate the map controls (because the map is only there to control if JS is available).
			[ ] add access keys? ask a screen reader user.
			[ ] add cursor control to the map (thanks for the idea, Christian).
				- do this when the map has focus? probably not.
			[ ] create a bookmarklet to redirect people from Google Maps (thanks for the idea, Christian).
				- see: http://scriptingenabled.org/2008/09/easy-youtube-greasemonkey-script/
			[ ] game pad control for people with physical disability
			[ ] style switcher for different interfaces
